Defination: Amicable numbers are two different natural numbers related in such a way that the sum of the
proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. That is, σ(a)=b and σ(b)=a, where σ(n) is
equal to the sum of positive divisors of n. The smallest pair of amicable numbers is (220, 284).
EXPLANATION: 1. σ(220) = 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110 = 284
             2. σ(220) = 1+2+4+71+142 = 220
